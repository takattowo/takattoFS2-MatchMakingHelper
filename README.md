# takattoFS2-MatchMakingHelper
This project enables you to skip any up comming match making by parsing packets. It is useful to avoid hackers/speeder or toxic players.
Could as well be using to skip all iso matches, cool right?

Thanks shalzuth for giving me the idea and ravahn for his amazing machina framework.
